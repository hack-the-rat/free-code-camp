                    <p>The modern web has quickly become a viable platform not only for creating stunning, high quality games, but also for distributing those games.</p>
                    <p>The range of games that can be created is on par with desktop and native OS counterparts.  With modern Web technologies and a recent browser, it's entirely possible to make stunning, top-notch games for the Web, not just simple card games or multi-player social games that have in the olden days been done using FlashÂ®, but also kick-ass 3D action shooters, RPGs, and more.  Thanks to massive performance improvements in JavaScript, just-in-time (JIT) compiler technology, and new APIs, you can build games that run in the browser (or on HTML5-powered devices like those based on Firefox OS) without making compromises.</p>

                    <p>Some code needs to be run frame-by-frame, so why attach that function to anything other than the browser's redraw schedule?  On the Web, <code>window.requestAnimationFrame()</code> will be the foundation of most well-programmed per-frame main loops.  A callback function must be passed in to it when it is called.  That callback function will be executed at a suitable time before the next repaint. Here is an example of a simple main loop:</p>
                    <code>
                        window.main = function () {
                            window.requestAnimationFrame( main );
                            
                            // Whatever your main loop needs to do.
                          };
                          
                          main(); //Start the cycle.
                    </code>
                    <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

                    <p> Mozilla applications gained support for <code>canvas</code> tag starting with Gecko 1.8 (i.e. Firefox 1.5).  The element was originally introduced by Apple for the OS X Dashboard and Safari.  Internet Explorer supports <code>canvas</code> tag from version 9 onwards.  For earlier versions of IE, a page can effectively add support for <code>canvas</code> tag by including a script from Google's Explorer Canvas project.  Google Chrome and Opera 9 also support <code>canvas</code> tag.</p>
                    <p>The canvas element is also used by WebGL to draw hardware-accelerated 3D graphics on web pages.</p>
                    <p>This is just a simple code snippet which uses the <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D.fillRect()</code> method.</p>
                    <p>HTML</p>
                    <code> canvas id="canvas" canvas </code>
                    <p>JavaScript</p>
                    <code>
                        var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
                        var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
                        
                        ctx.fillStyle = 'green';
                        ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);

                    <p>CSS is one of the core languages of the open web and is standardized across browsers according to the W3C specification.  Developed in levels, CSS1 is now obsolete, CSS2.1 is a recommendation, and CSS3, now split into smaller modules, is progressing on the standardization track.</p>
                    <p>This module starts with the basics of how CSS works, including selectors and properties, writing CSS rules, applying CSS to HTML, how to specify length, color, and other units in CSS, cascade and inheritance, box model basics, and debugging CSS.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>The Gamepad API is a way for developers to access and respond to signals from gamepads and other game controllers in a simple, consistent way.  It contains three interfaces, two events and one specialist function, to respond to gamepads being connected and disconnected, and to access other information about the gamepads themselves, and what buttons and other controls are currently being pressed.</p>
                    <h4>Interfaces</h4> 
                    <p>Gamepad: Represents a gamepad/controller connected to the computer.</p>
                    <p>GamepadButton: Represents a button on one of the connected controllers.</p>
                    <p>GamepadEvent: The event object representing events fired that are related to gamepads.</p>
                    <h4>Experimental Gamepad extensions</h4>
                    <p>GamepadHapticActuator: Represents hardware in the controller designed to provide haptic feedback to the user (if available), most commonly vibration hardware.</p>
                    <p>GamepadPose: Represents the pose of a controller (e.g. position and orientation in 3D space) in the case of a WebVRcontroller.</p>
                    <p>See also the extensions to the Gamepad interface for features that allow you to access the above information.</p>
                    <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope.  For example: </p>
                    <h4>Extensions to other interfaces</h4>
                    <p>Navigator</p>
                    <p><code>Navigator.getGamepads()</code>: An extension to the Navigator object that returns an array of Gamepad objects, one for each connected gamepad.</p>
                    <p>Window events</p>
                    <p><code>Window.ongamepadconnected</code>: Represents an event handler that will run when a gamepad is connected (when the gamepadconnected event fires).</p>
                    <p><code>Window.ongamepaddisconnected</code>: Represents an event handler that will run when a gamepad is disconnected (when the gamepaddisconnected event fires).</p>
