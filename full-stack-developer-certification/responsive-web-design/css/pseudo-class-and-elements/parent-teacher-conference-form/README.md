# Design a Parent Teacher Conference Form

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will practice how to add custom styles to radio buttons by building a parent teacher conference form. The HTML boilerplate has been provided for you.

Start by adding a `main` element with a class called `container`.

## Step 2

Next, inside your `main` element, add an `h1` element with the text `Parent Teacher Conference Form` and the classes `title` and `center`.

## Step 3

Next, add a paragraph element with the text `Please fill out the form below to help schedule your parent-teacher conference.`. Your paragraph element should also have the classes `description` and `center`.

## Step 4

Now it is time to add the `form` and `input` elements, which will represent the parent and student information.

Start by adding a `form` element below the `p` element.

## Step 5

The first section of the form will focus on the student's information, like their name and grade.

Inside the `form` element, add a `fieldset` element. Inside that `fieldset` element, add a `legend` element with the text `Student Information`.

Below the `legend` element, add a `label` element with the text `Full Name:` and a `for` attribute with the value of `student-name`.

## Step 6

The next step is to add the associated `input` element for the student's information.

Start by adding an `input` element with a `type` attribute set to `"text"`. Then add a `name` and `id` attribute, both set to `student-name`.

Next, add a `placeholder` attribute set to `E.g., Jane Doe`. And finally, add a `required` attribute.

## Step 7

Now it is time to add the form elements to collect the student's grade information.

Start by adding another `label` element with the text `Student Grade:` and `for` attribute set to `"grade"`.

Then, below your `label` element, add an `input` element with the `type` attribute set to `"number"`. The `name` and `id` attributes should be set to `"grade"`. The `placeholder` attribute should be set to `"E.g., 4"`. Lastly, your number `input` should be required.

## Step 8

The next step is the section in the form for the parent information.

Start by adding another `fieldset` element. Inside that `fieldset` element, add a `legend` element with the text `Parent/Guardian Information`.

## Step 9

Now it is time to add the form elements to collect the parent's information.

Start by adding a `label` element with the text `Parent/Guardian Name:` and `for` attribute set to `"parent-name"`.

Then, below your `label` element, add an `input` element with the `type` attribute set to `"text"`. The `name` and `id` attributes should be set to `"parent-name"`. The `placeholder` attribute should be set to `"E.g., Nancy Doe"`. Lastly, your `input` should be required.

## Step 10

In the next few steps, you will add the form elements responsible for collecting the user's preferred contact method.

Start by adding another `fieldset` element with a `legend` element nested inside. Your `legend` element should have the text `Preferred Contact Method`.

## Step 11

The next step is to add the `label` and `input` elements for the email contact method.

Start by adding a label with a class of `"contact-method"` and a `for` attribute set to `"email"`. The label text should be `Email:`.

Below your `label` element, add a radio button with `id` and `value` attributes set to `"email"`. The `name` attribute should be set to `"contact-method"` and the class should be set to `"contact-method-radio-btn"`.

Lastly, make sure this radio button is checked by default.

## Step 12

Next, add another label with a class of `"contact-method"` and a `for` attribute set to `"phone"`. The label text should be `Phone:`.

Below your `label` element, add a radio button with `id` and `value` attributes set to `"phone"`. The `name` attribute should be set to `"contact-method"` and the class should be set to `"contact-method-radio-btn"`.

## Step 13

It's a good practice to allow users to add additional notes or concerns.

Below your third `fieldset` element, add a new `fieldset` element. Inside, add a `legend` element with the text `Additional Notes`.

## Step 14

Now, add a `label` element with the text `Any specific concerns or topics you'd like to discuss?` and a `for` attribute set to `notes`.

Below this `label`, add a `textarea` element. Set its `id` to `notes`, `name` to `notes`, `rows` to `4`, and `cols` to `50`.

## Step 15

Finally, you should add the submit button for the form.

Below the last `fieldset` element, add a `button` element with the class `submit-btn` and `type` attribute set to `"submit"`. The text content of the button should be `Submit Form`.

With this, your HTML structure is complete!

## Step 16

Now that the HTML structure is complete, you should move on to the CSS styling.

Open your `styles.css` file. First, set a dark background color for the `body` and a light color for the text.

Select the `body` element and set its `background-color` to `midnightblue` and `color` to `whitesmoke`.

## Step 17

Next, you should style the main container. Select the element with the class `container` and set its `background-color` to the hex-code `#ffffff1a`.

A hex code is a six-digit combination of numbers and letters used in HTML and CSS to represent colors. It starts with a `#` followed by three pairs:

* The first two digits represent red
* The next two represent green
* The last two represent blue

For example, `#ffffff` is pure white because it has the maximum value for red, green, and blue.

You can also add two extra digits at the end to control opacity (called the alpha channel). In `#ffffff1a`, the `1a` makes the white color semi-transparent. The lower the alpha value, the more transparent the color appears. You'll learn more about hex codes later!

## Step 18

Continuing with the main container, give the `container` class a `width` of `80%` and a `max-width` of `600px`. Also, add a `border-radius` of `10px` and set `margin` to `20px auto` to center it horizontally.

## Step 19

Now, you should add some padding to the container. Set `padding` to `10px 20px`. This way, you set a padding of `10px` on the top and bottom, and `20px` on the left and right.

## Step 20

To make the container stand out, you should add a `box-shadow` set to `0 5px 15px black`.

This adds a shadow effect around the container. The values control the horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, and color respectively.

## Step 21

You added a `center` class to some elements in the HTML. Now, you should define that class to center those elements.

Target the `center` class and center the elements having it with a `text-align` property set to `center`.

## Step 22

The description text needs to be a bit larger. Select the element with the class `description` and set its `font-size` to `1.2rem`.

## Step 23

Time to style the `fieldset` elements to give them a distinct border.

Select the `fieldset` element. Set its `border` to `1px solid gray`, `border-radius` to `5px`, `margin` to `20px 0`, and `padding` to `20px`.

## Step 24

To make the `legend` text more prominent, you need to style it.

Select the `fieldset legend` element. Set its `font-size` to `1.3rem` and its `font-weight` to `600`.

`font-weight` controls the boldness of text.

Common values of `font-weight` are:

* `normal` → Regular weight (default)
* `bold` → Bold text
* `lighter` → Lighter than the parent element
* `bolder` → Bolder than the parent element
* Numeric values like:

  * `100` (thin)
  * `400` (normal)
  * `700` (bold)
  * `900` (extra bold)

## Step 25

Now, you should increase the font size for all `label` elements.

Select the `label` element and set its `font-size` to `1.2rem`.

## Step 26

By default, `label` elements are inline. To make them stack vertically (except for your radio button labels), use the `:not()` pseudo-class.

The `:not()` pseudo-class negates a selection. Here, it selects all `label` elements that do not have the class `contact-method`.

Select `label:not(.contact-method)`, then set `display` to `block` and `margin` to `10px 0`.

## Step 27

Now, you should style the `input` and `textarea` elements. It's often a good idea to start with general styles for `input` and `textarea`, then refine specific types.

Select `input:not(.contact-method-radio-btn), textarea`. Set `background-color` to `#ffffff1a`, `width` to `95%`, `border` to `1px solid gray`, `border-radius` to `5px`, and `padding` to `10px`.

The `:not(.contact-method-radio-btn)` part excludes radio buttons with that class from being styled by this rule. This way, we can apply general styles to most inputs while keeping radio buttons separate.

These styles will make your form fields wider and more readable. Try previewing the form to see how the layout changes.

## Step 28

To ensure the text entered into inputs and textareas, as well as their placeholders, is visible, set their color.

Select `input, input::placeholder, textarea` and set `color` to `whitesmoke`.

## Step 29

Now, it's time to customize the radio buttons. By default, radio buttons have a native browser appearance. You want to remove this so you can create a custom look.

Select the element with the class `contact-method-radio-btn`. Set `appearance` to `none`.

## Step 30

You should give your custom radio buttons a size and shape.

Still targeting `.contact-method-radio-btn`, set `width` to `20px`, `height` to `20px`, `border-radius` to `50%`, and `border` to `2px solid gray`.

## Step 31

By default, form elements like radio buttons might not sit perfectly aligned with their labels, especially if the label text is taller or has different font settings.

To align the radio buttons vertically with their labels, you can use the `vertical-align` property. This property controls how inline or inline-block elements line up vertically with the surrounding text.

Now, set `vertical-align` to `bottom` for the radio buttons. You can experiment with other values like `middle` or `top` to see how they affect alignment, but `bottom` usually works well for radio buttons next to labels.

## Step 32

Now, you should create the inner circle that will appear when the radio button is checked. You will use the `::before` pseudo-element for this.

A pseudo-element like `::before` lets you insert extra content before the actual element. This is often used for decorative purposes.

Targeting `.contact-method-radio-btn::before` pseudo-element, set a `display` of `block`, `content` of `" "`, `width` of `10px`, `height` of `10px`, and `border-radius` of `50%`.

## Step 33

You need to position the inner circle and make it initially invisible.

Still targeting `.contact-method-radio-btn::before`, set `transform` to `translate(3px, 3px) scale(0)`. The `translate` function moves the circle slightly, and `scale(0)` shrinks it to zero size so it’s hidden by default.

Also, add a `transition` of `all 0.3s ease-in` to create a smooth animation when it appears. This means any style change will animate over 0.3 seconds, starting slowly and speeding up.

## Step 34

Now, it's time to define what happens when the radio button is checked.

You are styling the inner circle only when the radio button is selected, so your selector should be `.contact-method-radio-btn:checked::before`.

In the rule, set `transform` to `translate(3px, 3px) scale(1)` and `background-color` to `lightgreen`.

The `transform` moves the inner circle slightly and scales it up to full size with `scale(1)`, and a background of lightgreen fills the circle with color to show that the option is selected, making it visible.

## Step 35

Time to style the submit button.

Select the element with the class `submit-btn`. Set `cursor` to `pointer` (to indicate it's clickable), `background-color` to `royalblue`, `color` to `whitesmoke`, `border` to `none`, `border-radius` to `6px`, and `padding` to `12px 20px`.
