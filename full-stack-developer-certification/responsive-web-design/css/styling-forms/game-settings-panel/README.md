# Build a Game Settings Panel

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will practice styling checkboxes by building a game settings panel.

All of the HTML boilerplate (`DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head` and `body`) has been provided for you.

Within the `body`, create a `div` element with an `h1` element nested inside. Give the `h1` element the text `Game Settings`

## Step 2

Immediately after your `h1` element, create four `label` elements.

Inside of each of the `label` elements, create an `input` element with the `type` attribute set to `"checkbox"`.

After each `input` element, give your `label` elements the following texts, in order: `Sound Effects`, `Background Music`, `Hard Mode`, and `Haptic Feedback`.

## Step 3

Now you will begin sprucing the page up with some CSS styling. Begin by creating the `body` selector.

Set the `body` to have a `height` property with a value of `100vh` and a `background-color` property with a value of `#f0f0f0`.

The `height` of `100vh` makes the `body` take up the full height of the browser viewport, while the light gray background color provides a subtle base for the page.

Lastly, set a `text-align` property with the value of `center`. This will center all inline-content contained within the page unless a child element overrides it with its own alignment.

## Step 4

Now that the body has been styled, you are going to create a container card for the Game Settings panel.

To start, add a class of `settings-card` to your `div` element.

## Step 5

Now it is time to style the `settings-card` container. Create a class selector for `settings-card`.

This will be where all of your formatting for the container will go. Set the `max-width` to `250px` to define the overall size of your container.

Next, set your `padding` to `20px` so that your content has space between it and the border of the container.

After this, create a rounded edge by setting your `border-radius` to `10px`.

Then set a `box-shadow` with the values of `0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)`. This will create a subtle "lifted" look that will create depth for the container.

## Step 6

Within your `.settings-card` selector set the `margin` property to `auto`.

Setting the `margin` property to `auto` automatically adjusts the margins of an element to evenly distribute the remaining space in its container, commonly used to center block-level elements horizontally.

And last, set a `text-align` property with the value of `left`. This will align the inline content, such as text, to the left side of its containing element.

## Step 7

Now create an `h1` selector and set the `text-align` property with a value of `center`. This will center your `h1` elements.

## Step 8

You need some spacing between the checkboxes and the labels. Begin by using the selector for `label` in your CSS and set a `display` property of `block`.

Next, set a `margin` property of `8px auto` to add vertical spacing between elements. This will create consistent spacing above and below each element, helping to separate content and improve readability.

Finally, set the `cursor` property to `pointer` on the `label` elements. This will change the cursor to a hand icon when a user hovers over a `label`, signaling that the element is clickable and improving the overall user experience.

## Step 9

Next up, you are going to enlarge the checkboxes for better visibility.

Begin by setting up a selector for `input`, but specifically targeting your `[type="checkbox"]`.

Within your selector, set the `width` and the `height` to `20px`. This makes it larger than it was before.

And to conform with your `cursor` setting that was set on the labels, add `cursor` and assign the value of `pointer` to it. After that, when you hover over the checkboxes it will display a pointer.

## Step 10

Now you are going to remove the default checkbox that is applied by browsers. Inside of your `input[type='checkbox']` selector, add `appearance` with a value of `none`.

Setting the `appearance` property to `none` will clear the appearance the browser applies to checkboxes, allowing you to show the style you want.

After doing so, since the checkbox won't be visible anymore, set a `border` with `2px` thickness, a `solid` style, and a hex code of `#f1be32`.

## Step 11

Now that you can see your checkbox again, you are going to finalize some styling options for it. Give them a rounded edge by adding a `border-radius` of `4px` to your `input[type="checkbox"]` selector.

Then give it a `background-color` of `white` to make the center of your checkbox stand out from the background of the container.

Since you are going to be setting up a custom transition for when a user clicks on the checkboxes, set a `transition` with the value of `all` and `0.3s` so that the transition happens smoothly over 0.3 seconds rather than instantly.

## Step 12

Next, set a `vertical-align` property with a value of `middle`.

The `vertical-align` property controls how `inline` or `inline-block` elements align vertically with the surrounding text or other inline elements. It's often used to adjust the vertical position of elements like images, icons, or text within a line.

Then finalize your checkbox with a `margin` property of `15px`.

## Step 13

In a previous lesson, you learned about pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS. You are going to apply that knowledge now by creating a combined type selector with pseudo-class selector.

First, start with the format for the type selector by setting it as `input[type="checkbox"]` and appending `:checked` to the end of it.

Next, give it a `background-color` with the value of `#f1be32`.

And lastly, set the `border-color` to have a value of `#e2a60d`.

## Step 14

Now that your checkboxes change color when the user clicks them, you are going to apply some styling to make it a little more obvious that the checkbox has been selected.

CSS pseudo-classes can be chained. You can add one pseudo-class or pseudo-element after another to target elements that meet multiple conditions.

Create a new selector for `input[type="checkbox"]`. Add the `:checked` pseudo-class followed by the `::after` pseudo-element. This allows you to add a visual indicator when the checkbox is checked.

Next, add `content` with the value of `"✓"`.

## Step 15

In the declaration for the `input[type="checkbox"]:checked::after` selector, set the `display` to `block`. Setting your `display` property as `block` makes the element a block-level element, meaning that it takes up the full width of its container and starts on a new line, allowing you to control its width, height, and spacing more easily.

Next, set `text-align` to `center`. This will center the inline content (like text, or inline elements) horizontally within the block. The block will still take up the full width of its container but everything inside it will be aligned to the center.

## Step 16

To finish setting up the visual effect of your checkbox, set the `font-weight` property with a value of `bold`. This will increase the visibility of the checkmark.

Now that this is easier to see, change the `color` to a value of `white`. This is going to change the color of the checkmark within the checkbox when it is checked.

Lastly, alter the `line-height` to a value of `20px`.

With that, you have completed the game settings panel!
