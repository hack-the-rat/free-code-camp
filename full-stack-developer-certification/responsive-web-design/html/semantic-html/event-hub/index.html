                    <h3>Macbeth</h3>
                    <p>Come one and all, ye goodly gentle folk, and cast your eye upon a treacherous tale of witches, wanting, heavy tyrant's yoke. Cast cruelly on the land of Scotland fair, and in advance of wicked hallow's eve, we conjured up a merry gentle band of tall tale-tellers for a day's reprieve in hopes that they could lend us both a hand. And so, good folk, please catch with bated breath, a most shambolic telling of Macbeth!  Featuring yon most noble stooges: Red as Lord Macbeth - Thane of Glamis and Blue as Lord Macduff - Thane of Fife, and ye honored and illustrious comedians, to whome the breaking of our brightly-colored stars is their singular purpose.</p>

                    <h3>Julius Caesar</h3>
                    <p>I ask of thee, my friends and countrymen, to lend your ears for this our ancient tale, which echoes from the lofty halls of Rome: a plot to end a tyrant, doomed to fail.  We gather on these sacred Ides of March, that we may better demonstrate the deeds of noble men who fell to civil strife – for knew they not where killing Caesar leads. Yon most noble stooges, Red and Blue, shall play the part as writ as Marcus Antonius, general and friend of Caesar, and Brutus, leader of the conspiracy against Caesar; and ye honored and illustrious comedians, to whom the breaking of our brightly-colored stars is their singular purpose, hope to break us with their wit!</p>
