# Build a Cat Blog Page

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will practice working with semantic HTML by building a blog page dedicated to Mr. Whiskers the cat.

The first section you will build out is the page *header*.

The `header` element is used to represent introductory content like page navigation and other introductory information.

Here is an example using the `header` element:

**Example Code**

```
<header>
  <h1>Main Page Title Goes Here</h1>
  <img src="example-logo.png" alt="Example logo" />
</header>
```

Inside the `body` element, add a `header` element.

## Step 2

The `header` will be responsible for displaying main title, image and page navigation for the blog.

Inside the `header` element, add an `h1` with the text of `Welcome to Mr. Whiskers' Blog Page!`.

## Step 3

In this introductory content, you will want to show an image of Mr. Whiskers with a caption.

Below the `h1` element, start by adding a `figure` element.

Inside the `figure` element, add an `img` element.

The `src` attribute of the `img` should have a value of `"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/css-photo-gallery/1.jpg"` and the `alt` text should have a value of `"a cat in the garden"`.

Below your `img` element, add a `figcaption` with the text `Mr. Whiskers in the Garden`.
