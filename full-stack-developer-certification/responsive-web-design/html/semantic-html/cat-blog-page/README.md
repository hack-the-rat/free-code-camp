# Build a Cat Blog Page

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will practice working with semantic HTML by building a blog page dedicated to Mr. Whiskers the cat.

The first section you will build out is the page *header*.

The `header` element is used to represent introductory content like page navigation and other introductory information.

Here is an example using the `header` element:

**Example Code**
```
<header>
  <h1>Main Page Title Goes Here</h1>
  <img src="example-logo.png" alt="Example logo" />
</header>
```

Inside the `body` element, add a `header` element.

## Step 2

The `header` will be responsible for displaying main title, image and page navigation for the blog.

Inside the `header` element, add an `h1` with the text of `Welcome to Mr. Whiskers' Blog Page!`.
