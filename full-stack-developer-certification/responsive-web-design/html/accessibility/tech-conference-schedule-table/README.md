# Build a Tech Conference Schedule Table

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will learn how to make accessible table elements by building out a schedule for a tech conference.

Start by adding an `h1` element with the text `Tech Conference 2025 Schedule`.

## Step 2

Now it is time to start building out the table.

Start by adding a `table` element below your `h1` element. Inside of the `table` element, add a `caption` element with the text `Schedule by Track and Time`.

## Step 3

The next step is to add the table head.

Start by adding a `thead` element below the `caption` element. Inside the `thead`, add a `tr` element.

## Step 4

Inside of your `tr` element, add four `th` elements. The first `th` element should have the text of `Time`, the second should have the text of `Track A`, the third should have the text of `Track B`, and the fourth should have the text of `Track C`.
