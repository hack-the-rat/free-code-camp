# Introduction to ARIA

## What Is the Purpose of WAI-ARIA, and How Does It Work?

Making static content accessible can be relatively straightforward, but dynamic content can be more challenging. This is where WAI-ARIA comes in.

Let's look at what WAI-ARIA is, its purpose, how it works, and some examples.

*WAI-ARIA stands for Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications*. It's a specification that enhances accessibility for dynamic content and UI (User Interface) components.

Note that WCAG and WAI-ARIA are not the same. WCAG provides general guidelines for web accessibility, while WAI-ARIA offers specific rules for making dynamic and interactive content accessible for users of assistive technologies.

So, the primary purpose of WAI-ARIA is to improve accessibility for dynamic content and UI components that do not have native HTML equivalents.

*WAI-ARIA works by introducing a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements to provide additional semantic information*. These attributes are categorized into roles, states, and properties.

ARIA role defines the purpose of an element within a website or web app. Here is an example of setting the role to `button` for a `div` element.

```html
<div role="button">Click Me</div>
```

By doing this you are indicating to assistive technology that the element is a button. Roles do not provide any functionality however. Merely giving this `div` a `role` of `button` will not make it act like a button. To make it look and behave like a button you would need to use CSS and JavaScript to get the desired result.

Here is an example of using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a custom `button` element.

 **NOTE** : Don't worry about trying to understand the CSS and JavaScript code. You will learn those languages in future modules.

```html
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
<div id="custom-btn" role="button">Click Me</div>
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

```css
#custom-btn {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 0.4em 1em;
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  color: buttontext;
  background-color: buttonface;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
  user-select: none;
  text-align: center;
}

#custom-btn:focus {
  outline: 2px solid Highlight;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

#custom-btn:active {
  background-color: #ddd;
}
```

```js
const button = document.getElementById("custom-btn");

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});

button.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
  if (e.key === "Enter" || e.key === " ") {
    e.preventDefault(); 
    button.click();
  }
});
```

It is always better to use the native `button` or `input` element with `type="button"` instead.

ARIA properties provide additional details about elements. For example, the `aria-labelledby` property lets you connect an element to a specific label:

```html
<h2 id="header-id">About freeCodeCamp</h2>
<button id="button-id" aria-labelledby="header-id button-id">Learn More</button>
```

This will make the elements understandable and navigable for users of assistive technologies.

To get the best out of WAI-ARIA, try to stick with native HTML whenever possible since it generally provides more accessibility out of the box.

Use WAI-ARIA only when HTML falls short, and don’t forget to test with assistive technologies like screen readers, or have people with disabilities test your work. Also, make sure your WAI-ARIA states and properties update with the content in real time. Avoid overusing ARIA, as it can often be confusing.
