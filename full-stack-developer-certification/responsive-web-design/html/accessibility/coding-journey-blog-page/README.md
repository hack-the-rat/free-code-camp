# Debug a Coding Journey Blog Page

## Step 1

Camperbot has created a coding journey blog page, but it looks like the page has some accessibility issues and bad practices. Your job in this workshop, is to fix these issues for Camperbot.

The first set of errors has to deal with the use of headings. In a prior lesson, you learned that it is best practice to only use one `h1` per page. But it looks like Camperbot is a using a few `h1`s.

Leave the `<h1>Welcome to Camperbot's Blog</h1>` alone and change the other `h1` elements to `h2` elements.

## Step 2

It looks like there are still some issues with the use of headings on the page. If you look at the first `div` element, there are two `h4` elements used as subheadings. A better practice would be to use `h3` elements for these subheadings since they are a level below the `h2` element.

Change the two `h4` elements to `h3` elements.

### Step 3

In the second post section, there is an `h5` element being used. It would be more appropriate to use an `h3` element here.

Change the `h5` element to an `h3` element.
