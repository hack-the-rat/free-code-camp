# Debug a Coding Journey Blog Page

Camperbot has created a coding journey blog page, but it looks like the page has some accessibility issues and bad practices. Your job in this workshop, is to fix these issues for Camperbot.

The first set of errors has to deal with the use of headings. In a prior lesson, you learned that it is best practice to only use one `h1` per page. But it looks like Camperbot is a using a few `h1`s.

Leave the `<h1>Welcome to Camperbot's Blog</h1>` alone and change the other `h1` elements to `h2` elements.
