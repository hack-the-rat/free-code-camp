# Importance of Accessibility and Good HTML Structure

## What Is Accessibility?

Accessibility involves creating products and services that everyone can use. *In the context of web development, it's making websites that everyone can understand and interact with*, including people with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities.

Some examples of disabilities that can impact users' online experience include:

* Blindness.
* Low vision.
* Color blindness.
* Deafness.
* Difficulty using keyboards, mice, or touchscreens.
* Attention disorders
* Memory issues.
* Difficulty speaking or understanding spoken language.
* Sensitivity to flashing lights.

These are just a few of many conditions that can impact users around the world.

To help you create accessible websites, the World Wide Web Consortium, known as W3C, developed a *set of international standards that you can follow to make your websites more accessible and easier to use for people with disabilities*.

These standards are known as the **"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines" (WCAG)**.

These guidelines are designed with four core principles in mind, known as  **POUR** .

* `P` stands for Perceivable. Users must be able to perceive the information that you are presenting. For example, you can provide alternative text for images, so users who access your website with a screen reader can understand them.
* `O` stands for Operable. Users must be able to interact with the user interface. For example, you can make sure that all functionality is accessible through the keyboard too, not just the mouse.
* `U` stands for Understandable. Users must be able to understand the information. For example, you can avoid complex sentences and use simple language as much as possible.
* `R` stands for Robust. A wide range of browsers and other tools, including assistive technologies, must be able to interpret the content.

Using semantic HTML is very helpful for making your website compatible with different browsers and assistive technologies.

If your content doesn't follow any one of these core principles, not everyone will be able to use your website.

To check if you are following these guidelines correctly, you can access the Quick Reference of the World Wide Web Consortium. There, you will find a comprehensive list of criteria and techniques.

Accessibility is essential for web development. By developing with inclusivity in mind, you can ensure that everyone can access and engage with your content, promote equality and create a better user experience for everyone around the world.

## What Are Screen Readers, and Who Uses Them?

Screen readers are assistive technology programs that help blind and visually impaired people use computers and mobile devices.

Screen readers are not just tools for the blind and visually impaired to access computers and mobile devices.

They empower these individuals to access education, work opportunities, and social media. This ensures digital inclusion and enhances their ability to participate fully in society.

There's a common misconception that screen readers are text-to-speech devices.

However, text-to-speech is just one of the features of a screen reader. Some screen readers even render the text to braille output instead of speech.

Apart from text-to-speech and braille output, other notable features of screen readers are navigation aids and web browsing assistance.

Screen reader programs are also not only made for the blind and visually impaired. Dyslexic individuals and people with cognitive disabilities also use screen readers. All the popular operating systems out there have screen readers built into them.

*macOS and iOS both have VoiceOver built-in*. You can turn it on on your computer by pressing `CMD + F5`. You can access it on iPhones through Settings.

Windows computers have Narrator built-in. You can turn it on by pressing `WIN + CTRL + ENTER`. NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) and Job Access With Speech (JAWS) are also available for Windows computers. NVDA is free and open-source, while JAWS is paid.

Linux has *Orca* for the desktop environment and *Speakup* for the Linux terminal.

Android phones have TalkBack built-in. You can turn it on by accessing *Settings > Special Function > Accessibility > Talkback.*

Some Android devices also have Ella and Select to Speak built in.

One major challenge for screen reader users is that many software developers don't design their products with screen-reader friendliness and accessibility in mind.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic, every developer needs to learn how to make their web software accessible for the blind and visually impaired, as well as other groups of people with disabilities.

This demonstrates empathy and a commitment to inclusivity, ensuring that all users can benefit from their work.
