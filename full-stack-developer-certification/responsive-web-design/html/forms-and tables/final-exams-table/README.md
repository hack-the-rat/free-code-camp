# Build a Finals Exams Table

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will practice working with HTML tables by building a final exam table for a group of students.

In previous lessons, you learned how to work with the `table` element to represent tabular data.

Inside your `body` element, nest a `table` element.

## Step 2

To add a caption to a `table`, you can use the table caption element.

Here is an example using the `caption` element:

**Example Code**
```<table> <caption>Football Scores</caption> </table>```

Inside your `table` element, nest a `caption` element with the text `Calculus Final Exam Grades`.

## Step 3

For the first section of the table, you will want to group the header content which represents the column labels for the student's first name, last name, and final exam grade.

The table head element, `thead`, is used to group the header content in a table.

Here is an example using the `thead` element:

**Example Code**
```<table> <thead> <!-- header content goes here --> </thead> </table>```

Below your `caption` element, add a table head element.
