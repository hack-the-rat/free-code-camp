# Build a Finals Exams Table

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will practice working with HTML tables by building a final exam table for a group of students.

In previous lessons, you learned how to work with the `table` element to represent tabular data.

Inside your `body` element, nest a `table` element.

## Step 2

To add a caption to a `table`, you can use the table caption element.

Here is an example using the `caption` element:

**Example Code**
```<table> <caption>Football Scores</caption> </table>```

Inside your `table` element, nest a `caption` element with the text `Calculus Final Exam Grades`.
