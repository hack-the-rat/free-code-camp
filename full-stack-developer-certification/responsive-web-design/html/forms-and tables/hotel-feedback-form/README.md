# Build a Hotel Feedback Form

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will practice working with HTML forms by building a Hotel Feedback Form.

For the introductory text, you will want to display the main title followed by a short note about leaving feedback.

Inside your `body` element, add a `header` element.

Inside the `header` element, add an `h1` element. The `h1` element's text should be `Hotel Feedback Form`.

Below your `h1` element, add a `p` element. The `p` element's text should be `Thank you for staying with us. Please provide feedback on your recent stay.`

## Step 2

Now, it is time to add the `main` element which represents the main content of the page.
