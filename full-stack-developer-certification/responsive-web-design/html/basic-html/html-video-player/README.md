# Build an HTML Video Player

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will build an HTML video player. The HTML boilerplate has been provided for you.

Create an `h1` element and give it the text `Working with the HTML Video Element`.

## Step 2

Next, create a `video` element below the `h1`. Over the next few steps, you will add the necessary attributes to make the video player functional.
