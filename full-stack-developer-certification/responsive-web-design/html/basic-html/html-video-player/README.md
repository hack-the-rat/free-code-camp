# Build an HTML Video Player

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will build an HTML video player. The HTML boilerplate has been provided for you.

Create an `h1` element and give it the text `Working with the HTML Video Element`.

## Step 2

Next, create a `video` element below the `h1`. Over the next few steps, you will add the necessary attributes to make the video player functional.

## Step 3

In a previous lesson, you learned about different attributes available to the `video` element. The `width` attribute determines the width of the video in pixels.

Add the `width` attribute to the `video` element with a value of `640`.

## Step 4

The `loop` attribute will restart the video once playback is completed. Think of an internet meme that repeats playback. Omitting the `loop` attribute will make the video playback once.

The `loop` attribute is a boolean attribute and does not need a value.

Add the `loop` attribute to the `video` element.
