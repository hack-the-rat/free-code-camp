# Welcome Message from Quincy Larson

![freeCodeCamp team](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/lecture-transcripts/freeCodeCamp_team.jpeg)

I'm Quincy Larson, teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org.

**Our charity's mission is to create free learning resources to help people learn math, programming, and computer science. And that's precisely what we've done for you here.**

This free, verified certification includes thousands of hours of lectures, interactive labs, and projects. You're going to build dozens of apps from scratch.

This is real coding. Everything's fully interactive. You'll immediately apply concepts as you learn them. And you'll get plenty of practice and spaced repetition along the way.

Over the past decade, tens of thousands of people who've learned to code using freeCodeCamp have gotten their first developer jobs. Many of these people don't even have a university degree.

**But I'm not going to sugarcoat it: learning to code is hard. You're going to spend many nights and weekends sharpening your skills by building projects.**

The good news is that the freeCodeCamp community is with you all the way. You can get help anytime you get stuck. **Just use the freeCodeCamp forum or the freeCodeCamp Discord. Or you can use the search bar and search through thousands of reference articles created by the community.**

In the next lecture, I'll explain how the freeCodeCamp curriculum and how the certifications work.

## How Does the Certification Process Work?

freeCodeCamp offers free, verified certifications. We've structured our curriculum to give you tons of practice with each tool and each concept, to help you prepare for your certification exams.

**You'll read short lectures and answer comprehension-check questions about them.**

**You'll code your way through step-by-step interactive workshops.**

**And you'll build dozens of projects from scratch.**

**Along the way, you'll pass dozens of quizzes and exams.** And you'll prove to us — and you'll prove to yourself — that you've mastered these tools and concepts.

**Toward the end of the curriculum, you'll build your own unique capstone project that we'll review and give you feedback on.** This will be a project worthy of adding to your professional portfolio.

**After you've completed the curriculum, passed the final exam, and built your capstone project, you can claim your free verified certification.**

**Your certification will have its own unique verification URL, unique serial number, and unique QR code.** You can add your certification to your résumé, LinkedIn, CV, and portfolio website.

At freeCodeCamp, we take developer education seriously. There are no shortcuts. You'll spend thousands of hours completing the curriculum.

Even if life gets in the way, and you have to stop for a while, we'll be here, ready to help you push forward with your skills.

You need to work hard, yes. But you also need to work smart.

Before we dive into the curriculum, I'm going to share some insight into how most people learn effectively, and how most people work smart.
