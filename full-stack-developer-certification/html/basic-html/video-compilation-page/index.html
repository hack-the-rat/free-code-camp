            <h1>The Trojan War</h1>
            <p>"Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Zeus fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another." So begins the Iliad, set toward the end of the Trojan War, a 10-year siege of the city of Troy by a coalition of Mycenaean Greek states.  But the Iliad is only a thin piece of the larger Trojan War.</p>

                <h2>Prologue to War</h2>
                <p>The origins of the war came from Zeus' plan to depopulate the world of his demigod descendents, first with the birth and later marriage of Helen and the judgment of Paris.  Helen's former suitors and demigod Achilles were then called to aide her husband Menelaus in retrieving her from Troy.</p>

                <h2>The Iliad</h2>
                <p>The Achaeans have landed on Troy, but tensions arise that put the decade-long siege in jeopardy.  Things get more complicated when the Greek gods get involved in the conflict, ending with the fated confrontation between Achilles and Hector.</p>

                <h2>Troy's Last Stand</h2>
                <p>The Trojan War hits its climax as the Greeks deal with Amazons and Ethiopians, with the deaths of Achilles, Ajax, and Paris setting things up for the Achaeans' last play: the Trojan Horse.  Following that, Troy gets sacked and burned to the ground, and nearly all its citizens are either killed or taken as slaves.</p>
