            <h1>The Merrie History of the Looney Tunes</h1>
            <p>If you were to name one studio as the king of animation it would be the company with the mouse mascot that is responsible for Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia and Bambi. But that’s largely because of the quality of their feature film output. If you had to choose one studio as the king of animated shorts, without question it would be Warner Bros. and no one else even comes close.  Many of their cartoons are widely considered the greatest animated films of all time. And that’s because WB hired the most talented gag writers, film directors, musicians and voice actors to make these films and gave them virtual creative freedom.</p>
