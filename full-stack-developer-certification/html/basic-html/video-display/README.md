# Build a Video Display Using iframe

In this workshop, you'll learn how to work with the `iframe` element by building a video display.

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will use the `iframe` element to display a video. The basic HTML boilerplate has been prepared for you.

Begin by creating an `h1` element with the text `iframe Video Display`.

## Step 2

Now, create an `iframe` element. Don't put anything in it yet.

## Step 3

In the first lesson on the `iframe` element, you learned it's a replaced element just like `img`. That means it can also take the `width` and `height` properties to determine how tall and wide it should be.

Give your `iframe` element a `width` of `560` and a `height` of `315`.
