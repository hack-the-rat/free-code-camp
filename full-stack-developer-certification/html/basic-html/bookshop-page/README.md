# Build a Bookshop Page

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will build a bookstore page by creating book cards that display information about different books. You'll practice organizing content using `div` elements, classes, and IDs.

Start by adding an `h1` element with the text `XYZ Bookstore`.

## Step 2

Below the `h1` element, add a `p` element with this text: `Browse our collection of amazing books!`.
