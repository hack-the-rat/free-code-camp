# Build a Bookshop Page

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will build a bookstore page by creating book cards that display information about different books. You'll practice organizing content using `div` elements, classes, and IDs.

Start by adding an `h1` element with the text `XYZ Bookstore`.

## Step 2

Below the `h1` element, add a `p` element with this text: `Browse our collection of amazing books!`.

## Step 3

The `div` element is used as a container to group other HTML elements. You will mainly use the `div` element when you want to group HTML elements that will share a set of CSS styles.

Below the `p` element, add a `div` element. This `div` will be a container for your book cards.

## Step 4

The `class` attribute is used to identify one or more elements for styling. Unlike the `id` attribute, class names do not need to be unique: multiple elements can share the same class.

Here is an example:

### Example Code

```<p class="example">example paragraph</p>```

Add a `class` attribute to your `div` element and set its value to `card-container`.
