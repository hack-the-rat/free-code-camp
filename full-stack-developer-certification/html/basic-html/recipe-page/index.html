            <li>8 oz sliced cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>3.5 oz garlic herb butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>ingredients for creamy tomato soup</li>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 small yellow onion, diced</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>28 oz canned whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
                <li> ¼ cup water (use the empty tomato can to measure your water, in order to add more flavor)</li>
                <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>one sprig fresh basil</li>
                <li>1 tsp sea salt, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 tsp brown sugar</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, add olive oil. Add diced onion and cook until soft (about 3 minutes). Stir in minced garlic and cook for 1 more minute.</li>
            <li>Pour in the canned tomatoes with their juices. Use the can the tomatoes were in to measure the water and add it to the pot. Doing this adds a little more tomato flavor. Add chicken stock and basil. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 -20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth (or carefully blend in batches using a stand blender).</li>
            <li>Stir in the heavy cream, brown sugar and a dash of sea salt. Simmer for another 5 minutes, then taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
            <li>While soup is cooking, heat olive oil and 1 tbsp butter on medium heat in a large pan. Spread softened garlic herb butter evenly on one side of each sourdough slice; place on a clean work surface, buttered sides up.</li>
            <li>Evenly top half the slices with 3-4 slices of cheddar. Top with remaining bread, buttered sides down.</li>
            <li>Cook the sandwiches for about 4 minutes per side until golden brown and crispy, and the cheese is melted. Press down slightly with a spatula for even cooking. (Work in batches if necessary.)</li>
            <li>Let the sandwiches cool for a few minutes before serving. Cut in half on a diagonal and serve alongside the tomato soup for dipping!</li>
