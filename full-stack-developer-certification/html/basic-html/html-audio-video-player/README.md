# Build an HTML Audio and Video Player

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should have an `h1` element for the main title of the page.
2. You should have two `section` elements.
3. Inside the first `section` element, you should have an `h2` element for the title of the video playing.
4. Below the `h2` element, you should have a `video` element with `controls` and `width` attributes. The `width` attribute should be set to `640`.
5. Inside the `video` element, you should have a `source` element with a `src` attribute pointing to a video file and a `type` attribute.
    * You can use `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/What is the map method and how does it work.mp4`.
6. Inside the second `section` element, you should have an `h2` element for the title of the song playing.
7. Below the `h2` element, you should have an `audio` element with the `controls` and `loop` attributes, and a `src` attribute that points to an audio file.
