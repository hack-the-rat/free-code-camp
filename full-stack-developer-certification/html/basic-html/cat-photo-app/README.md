# Build a Cat Photo App

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it represents the content and structure of a web page.

In this workshop, you will learn how to work with basic HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists.

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will continue working with basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists by building a cat photo app.

Begin the workshop by adding an `h1` element with the text of `CatPhotoApp`.

## Step 2

Below the `h1` element, add an `h2` element with this text:

`Cat Photos`

## Step 3

Create a `p` element below your `h2` element and give it the following text:

`Everyone loves cute cats online!`

## Step 4

Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with `<!--`, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with `-->`.

Here is an example of a comment with the `TODO: Remove h1:`

**Example Code**
```<!-- TODO: Remove h1 -->```

Add a comment above the `p` element with this text:

`TODO: Add link to cat photos`
