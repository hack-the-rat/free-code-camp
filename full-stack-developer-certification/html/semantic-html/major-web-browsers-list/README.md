# Build a List of Major Web Browsers

## Step 1

In this workshop, you are going to build a list of major web browsers. The HTML boilerplate has been provided for you.

Start by adding a heading to your page that reads `List of Major Web Browsers` using a `h1` element inside the `body` element.

## Step 2

As you recall from an earlier lesson, description lists are used to present terms and definitions in an organized and easy-to-read format.

Here is an example:

**Example Code**
```<dl> <dt>HTML</dt> <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd> <dt>CSS</dt> <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd> </dl>```

Below the `h1` element, create a `dl` element. This will hold the list of browsers.
