# Build Quincy's Job Tips Page

## Step 1

In this workshop, you will practice working with semantic HTML by building a web page that includes some of Quincy Larson's tips for landing a developer job. The basic HTML boilerplate has been prepared for you.

Begin by creating an `h1` element with the text `Quincy's Tips for Getting a Developer Job`.

## Step 2

Now, create a paragraph element below the `h1` element. Inside this paragraph add the text `Learning to code is hard, but as Quincy Larson says, You can become a developer.`.

## Step 3

In a previous lesson you learned that the `q` element is used to distinguish quoted text from the surrounding content.

Here is an example:

**Example Code**
```<p>Nancy said, <q>Learning is fun!</q></p>```

Most modern browsers will add quotation marks around an inline quote automatically when you use the `q` element.

Inside the paragraph wrap `You can become a developer.` in an inline quotation element, keeping the rest of the paragraph unchanged.
